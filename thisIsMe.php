										<strong>Let me introduce myselfâ€¦ </strong>
										 My name is Jim, it was a nickname my father used to call me as a child, and I have been called it ever since. I grew up on a farm in Scotland, with my Mother Rita and Father Ted. I was a sheep farmer all my life. I married Betty when I was 19, she used to work on the farm. We have 2 children Bill and June. I moved to Cambridgeshire after Betty died in 2019 so I could be closer to my daughter. June visits me every day, and I have 2 granddaughters Jane and Ellen, they are very important to me. Bill lives in Cornwall but I regularly speak with him on video call. I love looking at photos of Scotland and chatting about my time on the farm.
